## How Can I Hand In My Project?

Create a private GitHub repository and commit your code there. Provide READ permissions to [gendev@check24.de](mailto:gendev@check24.de) then, so that we can see what you have been building. When you hand in your application for the scholarship on our scholarship website, include the link to your GitHub repository.

What should be included:

- Your working code
- A toplevel README.md that explains your approach (including possible optimizations)
- We want to see your project in action. To achieve that there are two options:
    - Make your project runnable for everybody (e.g. by having a `docker-compose.yaml`). If this is possible for your project please add a section "How to run locally" to your project's README.md.
    - Run your project in your own environment and demonstrate it by using screen recording (there are plenty of tools that can support you with that). Upload that video somewhere (e.g. YouTube or some other cloud and include a link to it in your README.md). 
    - If it's a Web App you can also host it anywhere and provide the link in the README.md. Don't spend too much time on the hosting, your code is the focus.
